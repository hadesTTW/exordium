Exordium is a shared alternate history universe where an international revolution against capitalism occurs in the early 21st century.

The timeline of Exordium diverges from ours with the survival of the Empire of Brazil in 1889. The long-term butterfly effects of this divergence leads to the Empire of Japan managing to survive World War II despite the failure of the European Axis, with the resulting Cold War ending in a trilateral détente that is both extensively dissimilar yet familiar to our world.

Currently, the world of Exordium is primarily planned to be explored in two novels: First Love / Late Spring, which depicts the decades-spanning odyssey of an individual who discovers his soulmate in the most unexpected circumstances, and The Exordium, which depicts the life of another individual who heralds World War III between the International Soviet Republic and the rest of humanity.
