Exordium is a shared alternate history universe where the Empire of Brazil survives the republican coup d'etat in 1889.

Currently, the world of Exordium is primarily planned to be explored in two novels: First Love / Late Spring, which depicts the decades-spanning odyssey of an individual who discovers his soulmate in the most unexpected circumstances, and The Exordium, which depicts the life of another individual who heralds World War III between the International Soviet Republic and the rest of humanity.
