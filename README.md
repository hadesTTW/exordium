Exordium is an alternate history universe told in collaborative world-building, narrative fiction, and an upcoming grand strategy game.

The timeline of Exordium begins with the survival of the Empire of Brazil in 1889 and ends in 2020. In this timeline, the Co-Prosperity Sphere emerges victorious from the Second World War despite the failure of the European Axis, and the resulting Cold War ends in trilateral d√©tente.

The 2020s and the 2030s will be depicted in both narrative fiction and the game. This will lead up to a Third World War that occurs in the 2040s between the Mahlerian International Soviet Republic and the rest of humanity represented by the League of Nations. 

This is the open-source branch of Exordium.
